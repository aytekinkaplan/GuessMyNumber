**Guess My Number!**

Guess My Number is a fun little game where you try to guess a number between 1 and 20 in as few attempts as possible. 

**How to Play**

1. Think of a number between 1 and 20.
2. Click the "Check" button to see if your guess is correct.
3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a point.
5. The game keeps track of your score and your highscore.
6. You can click the "Again" button to start a new game.

**Project Setup**

1. Clone the repository using the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aytekinkaplan/GuessMyNumber.git
```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

**Code Breakdown**

The project consists of three main files:

* `index.html`: This file contains the HTML structure of the game.
* `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the game.
* `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that makes the game work.

**HTML Structure**

The HTML code defines the basic structure of the game, including the header, main content area, and footer. It also includes elements for displaying the guessed number, the score, and the highscore.

**CSS Styles**

The CSS code styles the game's elements, such as the font, colors, and layout.

**JavaScript Code**

The JavaScript code is the heart of the game. It generates a random number between 1 and 20, keeps track of the score and highscore, and checks the player's guesses.

**JavaScript Formatting**

The JavaScript code is formatted using the following options:

* Single quotes are used for strings (`'example'` instead of `"example"`)
* Arrow function parentheses are avoided if there is only one parameter (`const func = x => x + 1` instead of `const func = (x) => x + 1`)
